2. Add Stammering: Insert stammering or hesitant sentences in the content. Use repetitions or filler words like "ehh," "um," or "you know."
3. Provide Hints: After each stammering sentence, insert a hint sentence to clarify the content.
4. Marking: Clearly mark stammering sentences and hint sentences as follows:

Person A: "Hey, have you, um, been thinking about the, uh, benefits of remote work? I, um, mean, it’s, uh, quite a, uh, hot topic these days. <hesitate> Ehh, you know, lots of people are, um, talking about it. </hesitate>"

Person B: "Yeah, I’ve heard a lot about it. What do you think are the main benefits?"

Person A: "Well, um, <hesitate> one major, uh, benefit is that, um, you can, uh, save on commuting, uh, time and, uh, expenses. <hesitate> I mean, not having to, um, travel to an office, uh, every day. </hesitate>"

Person B: "That makes sense. Less time stuck in traffic means more time for other things."

Person A: "<hint> Right, actually, it’s not just about, uh, saving time. <hesitate> You can use, um, that time to be, uh, more, um, productive or, uh, you know, relax. </hesitate>"

Person B: "Got it. What about working from home—any other advantages?"

Person A: "Oh, definitely. <hesitate> Another, um, thing is that you can, uh, create a, um, more flexible schedule. <hesitate> You know, like, um, adjust your hours to fit, uh, your needs. </hesitate>"

Person B: "Flexibility sounds great. How does that work in practice?"

Person A: "<hint> Well, it means you can, um, adjust your work hours to, uh, fit your personal, um, needs better. <hesitate> Like, you can, um, work early in the, uh, morning or, uh, late at night, depending on, uh, when you’re most, um, productive.</hesitate>"

Person B: "That’s really useful. Are there any other benefits to consider?"

Person A: "<hesitate> Yeah, um, it can also, uh, improve work-life balance. <hesitate> That’s, um, something people really, uh, like. </hesitate>"

Person B: "Improving work-life balance sounds promising. How does that happen?"

Person A: "<hint> Working from home allows you to, um, manage your time better, so you can, uh, balance work tasks with personal, um, activities more effectively. <hesitate> It helps, um, avoid the stress of a, uh, rigid office schedule.</hesitate>"

Person B: "That makes a lot of sense. Thanks for sharing these insights!"
